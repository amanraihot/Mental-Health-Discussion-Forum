# Mental-Health-Discussion-Forum
We know that mental is still a taboo in our country, many people each year suffers from a variety of mental health conditions . So I came up with an idea of solving this problem I created Mental health discussion forum for people who are suffering can share their problems and get support. 

This forum it has following features:
 
 1 User can ask a question
 
 2 User can answer a question
 
 3 User can comment on an answer
 
 4 User can upvote a answer
 
 5 User can login logout
 
 6 User can add a profile

For authentication purpose I used django default authentication system

The frontend is done in bootstrap ,css,HTML

For forms I used crispy forms
